<div class="about_me_text">
    <p class='first'>Over the last four and a half years at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.springload.co.nz/">Springload</a> I’ve had the opportunity to work on a number of high profile and award winning websites. As Lead Front-end Developer I had the privilege of guiding and mentoring a crack team of developers through these projects for some high profile kiwi clients.</p>
    <p>This has been in an age when the front-end has seen unprecedented growth. Gone are the days of wrangling with IE6 and 7 rendering inadequacies. Today we’re working with bleeding-edge technologies pushing the limits of possibilities. We're no longer talking about a web that looks identical across all desktop devices. But one that needs to be accessible on a multitude of devices—mobiles, tablets and even TVs. Users expect access to information while they’re on the john or waiting at the bus stop.</p>
    <p>This calls for a responsive web approach. The code needs to be scalable and readable, and it needs to be dynamic, with thoughtful usability—enter css pre-processors and a new depth of Javascript. Image based text for headings are out; web fonts are in. Javascript animations have been largely usurped by CSS3 alternatives. XHTML has been toppled by HTML5. Media queries and feature detection have replaced browser sniffing.</p>
    <p>So, that’s the ever changing field of front-end development. It’s a new frontier, and an invigorating time to be exploring it. But now for something…</p>
    <h1>a little more personal</h1>
    <p>Richard [a.k.a. Reg] inadvertently invented the Internet in the 70’s when he tied an additional piece of string to his friends’ coconut phone in an attempt to eavesdrop on conversations.</p>
    <p>Having more recently been won over by the advantages of fiber-optics and wireless networks he has found little use for his string collection and instead spends his Mondays to Fridays building “web sites”, which he describes as “electronic picture books that want to sell you something”.</p>
    <p>His love for all things webby began oddly enough with a foray into 3D modelling and animation. But, not wanting to work 80 hour weeks creating hairs on hobbitses feets, he naturally settled on front-end web development. Honing his CSS skills for a decade gave him unparalleled understanding of the box-model—his now famous bouts with IE6 layouts were something to be seen!</p>
    <p>When he isn’t punishing himself on his Italian-made Pinarello he likes to play gut-barging with his three boys or read up on quantum physics in his hammock, figuring there must be an anti-Reg somewhere in the universe who actually understands it.</p>
